ITK 3.14.0 Setup Instructions
Last Updated by Stuart Golodetz on 10/05/10
-------------------------------------------

1. Create an ITK-3.14.0 subdirectory in the libraries directory.

2. Extract InsightToolkit-3.14.0.tar.gz into the ITK-3.14.0 directory.

	On Windows:

	a) Just extract it using something like the shareware version of WinRAR.

	On Linux:

	a) Change to the libraries/ITK-3.14.0 directory.
	b) Run "tar xzf ../setup/ITK-3.14.0/InsightToolkit-3.14.0.tar.gz".

3. Rename the new InsightToolkit-3.14.0 subdirectory of ITK-3.14.0 to 'source'.

4. Configure ITK using CMake and then build it.

	On Windows:

	a) Use the CMake GUI. Set the source and build directories to those in the ITK-3.14.0 directory. The install directory (i.e. CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX) should be set to a sibling of source and build called 'install'. Then just keep changing the options and configuring until you can generate a Visual Studio solution. In particular, if this is the first time you're building ITK, I recommend:

BUILD_DOXYGEN		OFF
BUILD_EXAMPLES		OFF
BUILD_SHARED_LIBS	OFF
BUILD_TESTING		OFF
ITK_USE_KWSTYLE		OFF

	b) The created solution (ITK.sln) will be in the build directory. Open it, and build the ALL_BUILD project.

	On Linux:

	a) Make a subdirectory of ITK-3.14.0 called build (this will be a sibling of the source directory) and change to it.
	b) Run "ccmake ../source" and set the options as per the instructions for Windows above.
	c) Run "make".
