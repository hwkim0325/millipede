wxWidgets 2.8.10 Setup Instructions
Last Updated by Stuart Golodetz on 10/05/10
-------------------------------------------

1. Extract wxWidgets-2.8.10.tar.gz into the libraries directory.

	On Windows:

	a) Just extract it using something like the shareware version of WinRAR.

	On Linux:

	a) Change to the libraries directory.
	b) Run "tar xzf setup/wxWidgets-2.8.10/wxWidgets-2.8.10.tar.gz".

2. Build wxWidgets with OpenGL support enabled.

	On Windows:

	a) In libraries/wxWidgets-2.8.10/include/wx/msw/setup.h:
		- Change #define wxUSE_GLCANVAS to 1 (it's 0 by default).
	b) In libraries/wxWidgets-2.8.10/build/msw, run:
		"nmake -f makefile.vc UNICODE=0 SHARED=0 BUILD=debug MONOLITHIC=0 USE_OPENGL=1"
	c) Repeat step (b) with BUILD=release.

	On Linux:

	a) Make a subdirectory of libraries/wxWidgets-2.8.10 called e.g. build28d.
	b) From within that directory, run:
		"../configure --enable-debug --disable-shared --with-opengl"
	c) Finally, run "make".

Notes:

* On Windows, the correct environment variables need to be set when you're building wxWidgets (or nmake won't be found).
  - To ensure this, run the "Visual Studio 200{5/8} Command Prompt" shortcut to get your command prompt.
* On Windows, you need to set wxWidgets_CONFIGURATION to msw and wxWidgets_USE_REL_AND_DBG to true in CMake.
* On Linux, you'll be asked by CMake to specify the location of wx-config when generating your own project files
  - This is at libraries/wxWidgets-2.8.10/build28d/wx-config
