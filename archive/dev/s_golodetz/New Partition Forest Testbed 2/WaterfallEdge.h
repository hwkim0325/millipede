/**
The WaterfallEdge class is an abstraction of an edge of the minimum spanning tree on which the
waterfall algorithm operates. Clients of the waterfall algorithm derive from this class and
override the merge_hook() method to specify what should happen when edges in the minimum
spanning tree they provide are merged. Typically, this will involve some merge operation on
the client data structure, but the waterfall algorithm does not (and should not) need to know
about this. The algorithm is only concerned with deciding which edges should be merged.
