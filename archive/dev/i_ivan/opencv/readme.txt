Building opencv on Linux:
- follow the opencv install guide: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide_Linux



Marking the positive images:
- download the improved version of ObjectMarker from http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~gherman/ObjectMarker.zip
- to build just run make in $OBJECTMARKER_DIR(note: you might have to change the install and library directories in the Makefile to point to your opencv build)
- add the opencv libraries to LD_LIBRARY_PATH(also mentioned in the opencv install guide)
- copy the positive images to $OBJECTMARKER_DIR/Release/rawdata
- run the $OBJECTMARKER_DIR/Release/ObjectMarker program
- this should produce an annotation file under $OBJECTMARKER_DIR



Creating the sample set:
- create a directory for your training images, with a subdirectory for the positive images, and one for the negatives
- copy the positive images marked with ObjectMarker into $DATA/$POSITIVES/rawdata
- remove the header from the annotation file created by objectMarker and copy it into $DATA/$POSITIVES
- run the following command to normalize all images to the same dimensions and package them into a vec-file
	$OPENCV_INSTALL_DIN/bin/opencv_createsamples -info $DATA/$POSITIVES/annotation.txt -vec $DATA/positives.vec -num $NUM_POS_IMAGES -w $IMAGE_WIDTH_IN_PIXELS -h $IMAGE_HEIGHT_IN_PIXELS



Training:
- before training, create an annotation file in the negatives directory listing the file names for all the negative images
- run the following command:
	$OPENCV_INSTALL_DIN/bin/opencv_haartraining -data $DATA/cascade -vec $DATA/positives.vec -bg $DATA/$NEGATIVES/annotation.txt -npos $NUM_POS_IMAGES -nneg $NUM_NEGATIVE_IMAGES -mode ALL -w $IMAGE_WIDTH_IN_PIXELS -h $IMAGE_HEIGHT_IN_PIXELS



Testing:
- create testing subdirectories under $DATA/$NEGATIVES and $DATA/$POSITIVES
- add the positive and negative test images and annotation files in these directories
- run the following command (which writes labelled images explicitly)...
	$OPENCV_INSTALL_DIR/bin/opencv_performance -data $DATA/cascade -info $DATA/$POSITIVES/testing/annotation.txt -w $IMAGE_WIDTH_IN_PIXELS -h $IMAGE_HEIGHT_IN_PIXELS

...or run it with "-ni" if you don't want anything written
	$OPENCV_INSTALL_DIR/bin/opencv_performance -ni -data $DATA/cascade -info $DATA/$POSITIVES/testing/annotation.txt -w $IMAGE_WIDTH_IN_PIXELS -h $IMAGE_HEIGHT_IN_PIXELS

On the supercomputer you need to put this under a qsub command, and
make sure to redirect the output if you want to capture it into a
file!
