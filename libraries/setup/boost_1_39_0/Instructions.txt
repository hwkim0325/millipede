Boost 1.39.0 Setup Instructions
Last Updated by Stuart Golodetz on 11/07/10
-------------------------------------------

1. Extract boost_1_39_0.tar.gz into the libraries directory.

	On Windows:

	a) Just extract it using something like the shareware version of WinRAR.

	On Linux or Mac OS X:

	a) Change to the libraries directory.
	b) Run "tar xzf setup/boost_1_39_0/boost_1_39_0.tar.gz".

2. Rename the boost_1_39_0 subdirectory of libraries to boost-setup.

3. Whilst most of the Boost libraries are header-only (i.e. there's no compilation needed), some of the programs in millipede use Boost libraries which need compiling: in particular, they use date_time, filesystem and thread. To compile those libraries, you need Boost Jam (bjam). There are binaries available for most common platforms, and I've put the zips containing the ones for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X in this directory. The others are available by following the link from the original instructions, found here:

http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_39_0/more/getting_started/index.html

(If they're no longer there by this point, the Getting Started instructions for the latest version of Boost will hopefully suffice. Search for it on the main page at www.boost.org.)

The actual executables need to be extracted from those zip files and placed in libraries/boost-setup. You then need to run the following at the command prompt (from within the boost-setup directory).

Windows (Visual Studio 2005):

bjam --libdir=..\boost_1_39_0\lib --includedir=..\boost_1_39_0\include --with-date_time --with-filesystem --with-thread --build-type=complete toolset=msvc-8.0 install

Windows (Visual Studio 2008):

bjam --libdir=..\boost_1_39_0\lib --includedir=..\boost_1_39_0\include --with-date_time --with-filesystem --with-thread --build-type=complete toolset=msvc-9.0 install

Linux:

./bjam --libdir=../boost_1_39_0/lib --includedir=../boost_1_39_0/include --with-date_time --with-filesystem --with-thread --build-type=complete toolset=gcc install

Mac OS X:

./bjam --libdir=../boost_1_39_0/lib --includedir=../boost_1_39_0/include --with-date_time --with-filesystem --with-thread --build-type=complete toolset=darwin architecture=x86 install


4. (Optional) Remove the boost-setup directory as it is no longer needed.
